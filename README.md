# Ceph RADOSGW Usage Exporter

[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) exporter that scrapes
[Ceph](http://ceph.com/) RADOSGW usage information (operations and buckets).
This information is gathered from a RADOSGW using the
[Admin Operations API](http://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/radosgw/adminops/).

This exporter was based off from both
(https://www.robustperception.io/writing-a-jenkins-exporter-in-python/) and the
more elaborate Jenkins exporter here
(https://github.com/lovoo/jenkins_exporter).

## Requirements

* Working Ceph Cluster with Object Gateways setup.
* Ceph RADOSGWs must beconfigured to gather usage information as this is not
on by default. The miniumum is to enable it via `ceph.conf` as below. There are
however other options that are available and should be considered
[here](http://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/radosgw/config-ref/).
```
rgw enable usage log = true
```

* Configure admin entry point (default is 'admin'):
```
rgw admin entry = "admin"
```

* Enable admin API (default is enabled):
```
rgw enable apis = "s3, admin"
```

* This exporter requires a user that has a capability of `usage=read` and
`buckets=read` 
```
radosgw-admin user create --uid=admin-monitor --display-name="Monitor RGW"
radosgw-admin caps add --uid=admin-monitor --caps="usage=read;buckets=read"
```

**Note:** If using a loadbalancer in front of your RADOSGWs, please make sure your timeouts are set appropriately as clusters with a large number of buckets, or large number of users+buckets could cause the usage query to exceed the loadbalancer timeout. 

For haproxy the timeout in question is `timeout server`

## Local Installation
```
git clone git@github.com:blemmenes/radosgw_usage_exporter.git
cd radosgw_usage_exporter
pip install requirements.txt
```

### Usage
```
usage: radosgw_usage_exporter.py [-h] [-H HOST] [-e ADMIN_ENTRY]
                                 [-a ACCESS_KEY] [-s SECRET_KEY] [-p PORT]

RADOSGW address and local binding port as well as S3 access_key and secret_key

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -H HOST, --host HOST  Server URL for the RADOSGW api (example:
                        http://objects.dreamhost.com/)
  -e ADMIN_ENTRY, --admin_entry ADMIN_ENTRY
                        The entry point for an admin request URL [default is
                        'admin']
  -a ACCESS_KEY, --access_key ACCESS_KEY
                        S3 access key
  -s SECRET_KEY, --secret_key SECRET_KEY
                        S3 secrest key
  -p PORT, --port PORT  Port to listen
```

### Example
```
./check_ceph_rgw_api -H https://objects.dreamhost.com/ -a JXUABTZZYHAFLCMF9VYV -s jjP8RDD0R156atS6ACSy2vNdJLdEPM0TJQ5jD1pw
```

## Docker Usage
Docker build (https://hub.docker.com/r/blemmenes/radosgw_usage_exporter/):
```
docker run -d -p 9242 blemmenes/radosgw_usage_exporter:latest \
-H <RADOSGW HOST> -a <ACCESS_KEY> -s <SECRET_KEY> -p 9242
```
Arguments can also be specified by environment variables as well.
```
docker run -d -p 9242:9242 \
-e "RADOSGW_SERVER=<host>" \
-e "VIRTUAL_PORT=9242" \
-e "ACCESS_KEY=<access_key>" \
-e "SECRET_KEY=<secret_key>" \
blemmenes/radosgw_usage_exporter:latest
```

Resulting metrics can be then retrieved via your Prometheus server via the
`http://<exporter host>:9242/metrics` endpoint.
